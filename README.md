# MoneyMoney
Almost a year ago I moved in with my friend to one flat. We've decided to split our all food bills. So the app takes the amount of money that each spend, saves it, splits it in half
and shows how much money the other person owns for the shopping.

# Pros
-I passed the class thanks to this app

# Cons
-Users are hardcoded into it so you can't change names of users other than in code
-Supporst only two users
-It's a console app in C++
